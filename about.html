                      <p>As co-founder of Bicis Del Pueblo I have been part of the complete build of the project. Bicis Del Pueblo is a community-based bike project that works towards providing low-income youth and families in the Excelsior District with the knowledge, tools and resources to incorporate bicycle into their everyday lives. I am a bike mechanic who has developed our curriculum, website, social media presence, program design, organizational structure, advisory committee, and project management. We have had tremendous outcomes and continue to plan to expand our efforts and reach more underserved communities in San Francisco.</p>

A place for mappers to share their projects and use their talents to have a further reach of influence. Too often maps are created for a limited audience, a class, a policy project, a presentation, a conference, a book, or a community meeting and is never made available for the wider public. I made this site to enhance the potential of the mapping community.</p>

                <h4>Blackstone Bicycle Works</h4>
                       <p>Volunteer / Chicago, IL / 2012</p>
                    
                      <p>This experience planted the seed for my current efforts in building the foundation for Bicis Del Pueblo. I worked as a bicycle mechanic and instructed underserved neighborhood youth (9-16 years old) on the mechanical skills necessary to build and repair bicycles. There was a powerful message in experiencing the power that a safe place to repair bicycles can have on youth from different back grounds.</p>

                    <p>As the teaching assistant for the Into to GIS course I was in charge of updating and designing the curriculum. I also was responsible for delivering class lectures and guiding the lab assignments using mapping to conduct analysis.<br>
                    I leveraged my knowledge of social issues, programs, data resources, and statistical analysis of various planning issues to teach, supply technical support and assistance, and critique the student projects on environmental issues, barriers to homeownership, and affordable housing development.<br>
                    In addition I taught GIS to Los Angeles teachers interested in geographic inequities. I supplied them the technical knowledge and resources about GIS and assisted them in designing a curriculum that could be used in the high school classroom that emphasized the the importance of making maps personal and clear for the intended audience.</p>

                    <p>I got to tutor and mentor 6th, 7th, & 8th grade students in math in the classroom and after school. For me efforts I was awarded BruinCorps Member of the Year for most accomplished corps member of 2009</p>

                    <p>It is difficult to fully capture the depth and variety of experiences of the Peace Corps, but to summarize the traditional work; I conducted independent research and developed a step-by-step manual, in Spanish, on how to use GIS and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies to improve the management of local statistical, physical, and geographic data. I trained the extension workers of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in how to use mapping to assist their effort to improve agricultural yields in rural Honduras<br>
                    Most of my time went to working on designing and presenting citizen participation charrettes to more than 300 community members and training extension workers, high school students, and teachers how to give the workshop.<br>
                    Lastly, I took the challenge of using my planning knowledge to teach local teachers and students how to create, manage, monitor, budget, and evaluate development projects.</p>
