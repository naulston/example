A place for mappers to share their projects and use their talents to have a further reach of influence. Too often maps are created for a limited audience, a class, a policy project, a presentation, a conference, a book, or a community meeting and is never made available for the wider public. I made this site to enhance the potential of the mapping community.</p>

                      <p>This experience planted the seed for my current efforts in building the foundation for Bicis Del Pueblo. I worked as a bicycle mechanic and instructed underserved neighborhood youth (9-16 years old) on the mechanical skills necessary to build and repair bicycles. There was a powerful message in experiencing the power that a safe place to repair bicycles can have on youth from different back grounds.</p>

                    I leveraged my knowledge of social issues, programs, data resources, and statistical analysis of various planning issues to teach, supply technical support and assistance, and critique the student projects on environmental issues, barriers to homeownership, and affordable housing development.<br>
                    In addition I taught GIS to Los Angeles teachers interested in geographic inequities. I supplied them the technical knowledge and resources about GIS and assisted them in designing a curriculum that could be used in the high school classroom that emphasized the the importance of making maps personal and clear for the intended audience.</p>

                    <p>It is difficult to fully capture the depth and variety of experiences of the Peace Corps, but to summarize the traditional work; I conducted independent research and developed a step-by-step manual, in Spanish, on how to use GIS and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies to improve the management of local statistical, physical, and geographic data. I trained the extension workers of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in how to use mapping to assist their effort to improve agricultural yields in rural Honduras<br>
                    Most of my time went to working on designing and presenting citizen participation charrettes to more than 300 community members and training extension workers, high school students, and teachers how to give the workshop.<br>
                    Lastly, I took the challenge of using my planning knowledge to teach local teachers and students how to create, manage, monitor, budget, and evaluate development projects.</p>

                  The self help books, programs, public seminars, represent a 10 billion dollar per year industry in the United States alone. We are a nation of people that are constantly attempting improve themselves. Personally, I am working on making my writing and editing skills a daily part of my life and I understand the message from so many, that practice makes perfect.<br>

                  While working on program design, management, and evaluation for the Bicis Del Pueblo project I have learned the need to continually reassess my skills as a leader and manager. One of my main goals is to improve as a manager and insure that the project meets all of its goals.<br>

                  I am taking advantage of some of the numerous resources available to receive Technical professional development in SQL, APIs, and other data management techniques that allow the use of open data. In that same vein I have looked to improve my art and graphic design skills as to best create influential data visualizations.<br>

                  I have been adverse to accepting my place as a leader and have recently found the necessity to enter that space with confidence in my abilities to lead, but still acknowledging my own limitations and limit the number of tasks that I can do well and not all the duties that I am capable of doing.<br>

							<h4>Project Details:</h4>
							<p>This interactive map was designed to examine the potential impact of the Bus Rapid Transit Line (BRT) in East Oakland, CA. It was created for The Oakland Sustainable Neighborhood Initiative (OSNI), which was convened to examine the impact of the purposed BRT line along the International Boulevard, between Lake Merritt and 109th Avenue. This resource goes beyond the typical paper maps and allows the user to interact with the information and understand the different variables, such as, land use, ownership, and crime that capture some of the on-the-ground phenomenon.

              <h4>Project Details:</h4>
              <p>City Council District representatives serve the residents in a specific geographic area.  These geographies are drawn with different motivations, but the elected officials still have the responsibility to have the best interests of their constituents in mind in their decision making process. The interactive Oakland Land Use Map provides a tool for politicians, governmental agencies, and the public to examine the concentrations of land use types through the city.  The map presents a count of parcels that have been assigned for the different types of land uses; Commercial, Exempt, Industrial, Institutional, Residential, Unknown, and Vacant parcels. Each district was ranked by the count and area dedicated to each land use type. A user can see the number of parcels for each use type at different zoom levels on the map. This map is a powerful tool and was designed for ease of use and understanding.<a href="http://www.arcgis.com/apps/SummaryViewer/index.html?appid=3544382ab4ce4153b32a5b7cc8c43943">See Full Map</a></p>

              <p>Potential Oil Spill Site in the City of Oakland</p>
              <h4>Project Details:</h4>
              <p>There is a current blind spot in the environmental justice movement.  Even though it ensuring that all people in the USA enjoy the same degree of protection from both environmental and health hazards no matter what community they live, learn, worship, and work in is a cornerstone of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), they have failed to respond to the major emerging environmental hazard of crude oil spills due to train derailment. <br> We analyzed the potential impact of a derailment of a train transporting oil in the City of Oakland, California. This project was designed to provide a clear impression to the governing bodies responsible for ensuring environmental justice, US EPA, California Environmental Potential Agency and local jurisdictional bodies, of the potential disaster in the City of Oakland.<br> We have created two maps that demonstrate the potential impact of the derailment of a train carrying oil through the City of Oakland California. The first map shows the areas that are vulnerable for the entire city, while the second map lays out a scenario of a theoretical derailment site.

              <p>Disparities in the Current San Francisco Bicycle Infrastructure</p>
              <h4>Project Details:</h4>
              <p>Bicycling is an inexpensive mode of transportation, however in a biking mecca like San Francisco the question arises if the bike resources are equalitably distributed throughout the city.  <br>  Bicis Del Pueblo, a bike start-up co-operative bike shop based in the Excelsior neighborhood, views the inability to address the biking issues in District 11 and the Excelsior neighborhood as evidence they have not been committed to building transportation equity.  Bicis Del Pueblo will demonstrate, through the most current available data, how the City government has ignored the communities we serve as they allocate financial and material investments for bike infrastructure throughout the City.<br>
              The data shows the City has yet to make an equitable investment in District 11 or the Excelsior neighborhood as it pertains to bike parking, racks, lanes, paths, routes, share stations, and other infrastructure projects.  Even as the entire City has been categorized by Bike Score as very bikeable, with many areas as a biker’s paradise, our service area have a substantially lower score because of the lack of existing infrastructure.  This decision by the City to exclude our communities has an impact on the specific people living in our service area.

              <p>City of Oakland California Voting</p>
              <h4>Project Details:</h4>
              <p>An comparative examination of the mayoral elections in the City of Oakland in the years 2010 and 2014.  We looked at how the results of these elections ended up with a different public sentiment for each mayor.<br>
                We used this example to examine that elections say about the voting public and then recommend steps that can be taken to improve how elections are conducted in the United States without greatly increasing the cost of elections.
